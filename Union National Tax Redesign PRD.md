# **Product Requirements Document (PRD): Union National Tax Redesign**

Version: 1.0  
Status: Draft  
Date: December 30, 2025  
Project Lead: \[Your Agency Name\]

## **1\. Executive Summary**

The goal is to rebuild unionnationaltax.com from a generic brochure site into a high-conversion lead generation engine. The current brand suffers from "identity camouflage"—it looks like a generic national tax relief firm. The redesign must pivot the brand to position **Union National Tax** as a boutique, high-authority strategic partner (S-Corp specialists) for small business owners in Utah and beyond.

## **2\. Problem Statement**

* **Brand Confusion:** The name triggers associations with aggressive "tax debt relief" scams. The current site does not do enough to visually distinguish the firm as a legitimate, local, expert practice.  
* **Low Engagement:** The site lacks interactive tools (calculators) or compelling lead magnets beyond a "Contact Us" form.  
* **Generic Messaging:** "Clarity. Strategy. Results." does not communicate the specific value of S-Corp elections or fractional CFO services.

## **3\. Strategic Goals & KPIs**

* **Primary Goal:** Increase qualified consultation bookings by **40%** within 6 months of launch.  
* **Secondary Goal:** Establish Jason Astwood (EA) as a thought leader to justify higher retainer fees.  
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**  
  * Conversion Rate (Visitor to "Strategy Call" booking).  
  * Engagement Time on "S-Corp Playbook" page.  
  * Reduction in bounce rate (Target: \<40%).

## **4\. User Personas (Target Audience)**

### **Primary: The "Overwhelmed Contractor"**

* **Who:** HVAC, General Contractor, or Real Estate agent earning $100k+.  
* **Pain Point:** "I made money this year, but I have a huge tax bill and my current CPA never talks to me."  
* **Goal:** Wants to save money immediately and stop worrying about the IRS.

### **Secondary: The "Scaling E-Com Owner"**

* **Who:** Digital business owner needing fractional CFO insights.  
* **Pain Point:** "I don't know my profit margins or cash flow."  
* **Goal:** Needs monthly reporting and strategy, not just annual filing.

## **5\. Functional Requirements**

### **A. Core Pages & Architecture**

1. **Homepage:**  
   * **Hero Section:** Video background (office environment, real people) to prove legitimacy. Headline focused on outcome: *"Stop Overpaying the IRS."*  
   * **Trust Bar:** "As seen in..." or logos of software used (QuickBooks, Xero).  
   * **The "S-Corp Calculator" (Critical Feature):** A slider widget where users input Net Income and see "Potential Tax Savings."  
2. **Service Pages (The "Product"):**  
   * Split into: *Tax Compliance* (Basic), *S-Corp Management* (Core), and *Fractional CFO* (Premium).  
   * Each page must have a dedicated FAQ section for SEO.  
3. **About / The Team:**  
   * Must feature Jason Astwood, EA heavily.  
   * **Differentiation:** "Why we are NOT a national call center."  
4. **Client Portal:**  
   * Secure login button (top right, sticky) linking to their existing portal (e.g., TaxDome, Canopy).

### **B. Technical Specifications**

* **CMS:** WordPress (recommended for flexibility and SEO) or Webflow (for high-end visuals).  
* **Speed:** Mobile score of 90+ on Google PageSpeed Insights.  
* **SEO:**  
  * **Local Schema:** Hardcoded JSON-LD schema for "Accounting Service in Orem, UT."  
  * **Service Schema:** Markup for "Tax Preparation" and "Bookkeeping."  
* **Integrations:**  
  * **Calendly/HubSpot:** Direct booking for strategy calls.  
  * **Newsletter:** Integration with Mailchimp/ActiveCampaign for "S-Corp Playbook" downloads.

## **6\. UX/UI & Design Guidelines**

### **Visual Direction: "The Modern Fortress"**

* **Vibe:** Secure, Established, but Modern. Think "Fintech meets Law Firm."  
* **Palette:**  
  * *Primary:* Deep Navy Blue (Trust).  
  * *Secondary:* Gold or Copper (Wealth/Prestige).  
  * *Accent:* Clean White/Light Grey (Clarity).  
* **Typography:** Serif headings (Authority) paired with Sans-Serif body text (Readability).

### **Content Strategy**

* **Voice:** "The Strict but Fair Expert." Not playful, not dry. Authoritative.  
* **Key Hook:** "We don't just file forms; we build wealth."

## **7\. Two Design Concepts (Alternative Solutions)**

| Feature | Concept A: "The Personal Brand" | Concept B: "The System & Product" |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Focus** | Centers on Jason Astwood (The Expert). | Centers on "The S-Corp Playbook" (The Solution). |
| **Hero Image** | High-quality portrait of Jason looking confident. | Abstract 3D graphic of a puzzle being solved or a building blueprint. |
| **Copywriting** | "Work with Jason." | "Install the System." |
| **Best For** | If Jason wants to remain the face of every deal. | If the goal is to sell the firm eventually or scale beyond Jason. |

## **8\. Budget & ROI Considerations**

* **Estimated Cost (Agency Level):** $8,000 \- $15,000 for a custom WordPress build \+ Copywriting.  
* **ROI Analysis:**  
  * *Current Avg Client Value:* \~$5,000/year.  
  * *Break-even:* The new site only needs to convert **2-3 new high-value clients** to pay for itself.  
  * **Ad Efficiency:** By adding the "S-Corp Calculator," Cost-Per-Lead (CPL) on Google Ads usually drops by 30-50% because users engage longer.

## **9\. Implementation Roadmap**

* **Phase 1: Discovery (Weeks 1-2):** Competitor analysis, finalize sitemap, gather testimonials.  
* **Phase 2: Content & Copy (Weeks 3-4):** Write new copy with a focus on "differentiation."  
* **Phase 3: Design & Wireframes (Weeks 5-6):** Approval of visual style.  
* **Phase 4: Development (Weeks 7-9):** Build, integrate calculator, SEO setup.  
* **Phase 5: QA & Launch (Week 10):** Mobile testing, form testing, go-live.

## **10\. TL;DR Summaries**

### **TL;DR for Pros (Devs/Designers)**

* **Stack:** WordPress \+ Elementor Pro (or Bricks Builder).  
* **Critical Asset:** Custom JS calculator for S-Corp savings.  
* **Performance:** Must pass Core Web Vitals.  
* **Tracking:** GTM setup with conversion events on "Call Booked" and "Calculator Used."

### **Quickstart for Newbies (Client)**

* **The Plan:** We are rebuilding your "digital office."  
* **The Difference:** Instead of a digital business card, we are building a machine that answers questions and convinces people to hire you before they even talk to you.  
* **First Step:** We need better photos of you and the team.

## **11\. Prompt Improvement Tips**

*(Use this to refine the PRD using AI)*

* **Instead of:** "Give me ideas for the homepage."  
* **Try this:** "Act as a UX Researcher specializing in Fintech. Critique the proposed 'S-Corp Calculator' feature. What friction points might stop a user from entering their income data, and how can we use UI design to reassure them of privacy?"

## **12\. What's Next?**

**Project Management Action Items:**

1. **Immediate (Week 1):** Audit the "About Us" page to ensure it clearly distinguishes the firm from similarly named competitors. Add a physical photo of the building exterior if possible to prove legitimacy.  
2. **Short Term (Month 1):** Implement the "Tax Savings Calculator" on the homepage to capture leads.  
3. **Mid Term (Month 3):** Launch a video testimonial campaign featuring 3 key clients from the target industries (Construction, Real Estate, etc.).  
4. **Long Term (6 Months):** Evaluate a rebrand (Option A or B above) if brand confusion with "National Tax" entities persists in lead feedback.
